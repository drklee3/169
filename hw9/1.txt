Functional programming, while potentially daunting to some, provides benefits in
more performant and correct code. By having immutability and statelessness, it
allows for programs to be easily parallelized across multiple threads or
processes.  With this core idea, functional programming can be applied to
many everyday languages now, including Python and JavaScript. When using
functional styled programming, logic can be abstracted to functions that carry
out smaller tasks, then brought together again with functional collection
methods such as map() and reduce() to make programs both have the benefits
mentioned above and be more concise.
